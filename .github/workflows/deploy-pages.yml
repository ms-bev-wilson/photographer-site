name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

# Deploy the repository root to GitHub Pages using the official actions.
# This uses the automatically provided GITHUB_TOKEN and will create a Pages
# deployment. It publishes the repository root, which is appropriate for
# static sites that don't need a build step. If you later add a build step,
# change the `path` in `upload-pages-artifact` to the build output folder.
